Overview of the Project

Project: Creating a personal portfolio using CSS and HTML.

Objective: The objective of this project is to design and develop a personal portfolio website using HTML and CSS that effectively presents personal, academic, and professional information.

Input: The inputs used in this project include static text such as the developer’s name, professional tagline, personal bio, skills, project titles and descriptions, along with a profile image file, a resume in PDF format, contact details like email and phone number, and styling instructions provided through an external CSS file. All inputs are predefined by the developer and embedded directly within the HTML and CSS code.

Functions: This project does not use programming functions as it is developed using HTML and CSS. However, functional behavior is achieved through HTML elements and CSS rules such as sectioning content using semantic tags (header, section, footer), displaying images with the <img> tag, providing file download functionality using the <a> tag, styling and layout control through CSS selectors and classes, and content organization using lists and containers. These elements collectively perform the functional operations of presenting, styling, and structuring the web page.
