Project: Creating a Basic Calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
Objective:

The objective of this project is to design and develop a functional calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The project aims to strengthen understanding of core front-end web development concepts, including user interface design, event handling, conditional logic, and dynamic interaction between HTML elements and JavaScript, while ensuring a simple, user-friendly, and visually structured layout.

Key Points:

Developed a functional calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Implemented a clean and interactive user interface with a display screen and buttons.

Used CSS Grid system for proper alignment and layout of calculator buttons.

Enabled basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Applied JavaScript event listeners to handle user interactions.

Used operators, conditional statements, and error handling for calculations.

Ensured proper input display and result output functionality.

Focused on simplicity, usability, and visual clarity.

Strengthened understanding of JavaScript logic and DOM manipulation.

Designed the project in a way that can be easily extended with advanced features.

Input:

The inputs used in this project include numerical values entered through calculator buttons, arithmetic operators selected by the user, and control inputs such as clear and delete actions. All inputs are provided interactively through button clicks on the calculator interface. These inputs are captured dynamically using JavaScript and displayed on the calculator screen in real time.

Functions:

The calculator project utilizes JavaScript functions to perform its operations. Functional behavior is achieved through event handling and logic implementation, including capturing user input through button clicks, updating the display screen dynamically, performing arithmetic calculations using operators, clearing or modifying input values, and handling invalid expressions using conditional statements and error handling. These functions collectively enable the calculator to process user input and generate accurate results.

Technologies Used

HTML5 – Used to create the structure of the calculator interface, including display and buttons.

CSS3 – Used for styling, layout design, and implementing the grid system for button alignment.

JavaScript – Used to handle user input, perform calculations, and control dynamic behavior.

Visual Studio Code – Used as the code editor for development.

Web Browser (Chrome/Edge) – Used to execute and test the calculator application.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, the Calculator project successfully demonstrates the practical application of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in building an interactive web application. The project enhanced understanding of user interface design, CSS Grid layouts, JavaScript event handling, and basic programming logic. It provides hands-on experience in creating dynamic web functionality while maintaining a clean and user-friendly design. This project serves as a strong foundation for developing more advanced applications by incorporating features such as keyboard input support, scientific calculations, or responsive enhancements.
